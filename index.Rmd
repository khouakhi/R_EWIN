In this exercise, we are going to learn: 

1. How to create an R project
2. How to install/load the required libraries
3. How to import/read data to Rstudio
4. Check the data (Summary statistics, variable names...)
5. Use the dplyr package verbs to tidy up the data
6. Summarise and aggregate the data
7. Visualize the data using ggplot2


To demonstrate and achieve the above objectives, We will be using 15-min flow data from the EA. The gauging station is located on river soar at Littlethorpe.

Before starting if you don't have R and Rstudio installed in your machine, follow the links below to download R and Studio (install R first before installing Rstudio)

* [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) 
* [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) 



### 1. Create an R project

It is a good practice to create an R project before starting any R project, this allows you to:

* keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder
* use relative paths to files rather than absolute paths
* Easily move your project around on your computer and share it with others 

To create an R project, let's first create an empty folder named for example __my_Rproject__ (say in your Desktop) and then create 3 other sub-folders named _data_, _scripts_, and _plots_ within my_Rproject folder. Next, open Rstudio, from the main menu, go to file, new project, choose Existing Directory option and then browse to my_Rproject folder and click Create Project.

### 2. Data

In R, you can either read the data from an online or local source, but for the purpose of this exercise, we will download flow data from [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdqyagbhm11glpo/Littlethorpe%204082%2015%20Minute%20Flow%201983%20to%202011.csv?dl=1) and place the it in the sub-folder _data_  


### 3. Load the necessary libraries

To install packages, two options are available:
1. From the packages window in Rstudio then _install_ and type the package name 
2. From the console, use the the function `install.packages()` for example `install.packages("tidyverse")` 

Now install the following packages that we will be using: 

`install.packages("tidyverse")`
`install.packages("lubridate")`
`install.packages("dygraphs")`
`install.packages("glm2")`
`install.packages("xts")`

Next we will load these packages:

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,include=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}
# load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(dygraphs)
library(glm2)
library(xts)
```


### 4. Read the data

The data contains some rows that we don't need so we will skip them using the `skip` argument from `read_csv()` function to skip the first 20 rows.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
# First list files in the data folder
files <- list.files("./data")
files
# Read the file and use skip argument
flow <- read_csv("./data/Littlethorpe_4082.csv",skip = 20)
```


### 5. Variable names

The variable names are a bit messy and need some adjustments. let's change them using the function `colnames()`

```{r, eval=T, echo=T}

# Change variable names 
colnames(flow) <- c("time_stamp","flow","quality","interp","tags","comments")
# print the flow
flow
```


### 6. Summary statistics

let's check how the data look like and get some descriptive statistics 

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}
# get summary stat of data  
summary(flow)                
# or 
glimpse(flow) 
# data dimensions
dim(flow) 
# number of columns
ncol(flow)
# number of rows
nrow(flow)
```


### 7. Check variables content

For example, we are going to check the different comments of the variable `comment` using `unique` function to show unique elements

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}
# Check the comments variable                 
unique(flow$comments) 

```

### 8. date and time 

From the summary results you can see the class of the variable time_stamp is a character so it needs to be changed to datetime class. But before doing that, let's try some examples of how you can use `lubridate` package to handle manipulate date times 

```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
## Examples of date time parsing:
my_brthdy <- "13/5/1984 13;20-00"
parsed_date <- dmy_hms(my_brthdy)
parsed_date
# extract year
year(parsed_date)
# extract month
month(parsed_date)
# extract day
day(parsed_date)
# extract minutes
minute(parsed_date)
# make a date
make_datetime(c(1980))
```

### 9. Application to our data

#### 9.1 `mutate` verb:

Here we are going overwrite the column time_stamp using `mutate()` and we use `dmy_hms()` to parse the time stamp.
```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}

# first thing to do is to parse date time 
# in order to do that we are going to use functions ymd() and the mutate()
flow1 <- flow %>% mutate(time_stamp = dmy_hms(time_stamp))
flow1
```

You can notice that the time_stamp variable class is changed to dttm

#### 9.2 `Select()` verb to choose the relevent variables 

For example let's say we wanted to keep just time_stamp,flow,quality,interp,tags variables. 
You can either write the variable number or the variable name

```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
flow2 <- flow1 %>% select(time_stamp,flow,quality,interp,tags) 
#print flow3
flow2
```


#### 9.3 Extract year, month, day, and time from the the time_stamp variable

```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
# In order to subset the data for example annually we would need to separate the years from time_stamp

flow3 <- flow2 %>% mutate(year = year(time_stamp),
                            month = month(time_stamp),
                            day = day(time_stamp),
                            hour = hour(time_stamp),
                            min = minute(time_stamp))
# Print flow3 
flow3
```

### 10. Check for missing data 


```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}

## check for NAs 
# 1- check if yes or no there is missing data 
anyNA(flow3$flow)
# 2- check how many missing values
sum(is.na(flow3$flow))
# 3- locate the missing values 
missed <- flow3 %>% filter(quality == "M")
missed
# or
missed <- flow3 %>% filter(is.na(flow))
missed
```

Now let's check the number of records each year and see how how complete our data is 

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}
#Calculate the number of records each year 
records <- flow3 %>% group_by(year) %>% tally()
records
```

### 11. Summarizing the data

To illustrate the use of `group_by()` and `summarize()` we can for example we can aggregate the data to hourly time stamp or computing the annual maximum flow 

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}
# Aggregate the data to hourly/daily
hflow <- flow3 %>% group_by(year,month,day,hour) %>% 
                        summarize(flow = mean(flow, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                  datetime = first(time_stamp))
# print hflow
hflow

# Calculate the annual max flow
am_flow <- flow3 %>% group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(am_flow = max(flow, na.rm = TRUE))
am_flow

# or for example Choosing the number of days where the flow exceeds the 99.5th percentile 
# 1: find the Q99.5   
Q995 <- quantile(hflow$flow, prob = 0.995, na.rm = T)

# 2: values exceeding the Q995  
Q995_flow <- hflow %>% filter(flow >= Q995)
Q995_flow
# 3 find the number of hours each year 
exceedance <- Q995_flow %>% group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(events = n())
exceedance
# select just years where no values exceed the threshold (this example with show also how you can )
non_exce <- hflow %>% ungroup(year, month, day) %>%
  select(year) %>% distinct(year) %>%  
  filter(!year %in% exceedance$year)
# add 0 if no event  
non_exce$events <- 0 
exceedance <- full_join(exceedance,non_exce, by = c("year", "events")) %>% arrange(year)
exceedance
```

### 12. Data visualization using ggplot2

Let's for example select and plot flow measurements of the year 2000:

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}
#1- plot one year of hourly data
one_year <- hflow %>% filter(year == 2000 ) 
# line plot 
ggplot(data = one_year, aes(x = datetime, y = flow))+
  geom_line(color="blue")
# histogram
ggplot(data = one_year, aes(x = flow))+
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue")
# box plot
ggplot(data = one_year, aes(x = datetime, y = flow, group = month))+
  geom_boxplot()

```

Now let's plot multi-plots using the ggplot's facet wrap function

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}
# several plots 
# Facet wrap (for several plots)
multi_yr <- hflow %>% filter(year %in% 2000:2008 ) 
# line graphs
  ggplot(data = multi_yr, aes(x = datetime, y = flow))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_line(color = "blue")+
  facet_wrap(~year,scales = 'free_x')+
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b")
# histograms
  ggplot(data = multi_yr, aes(x = flow))+
    geom_histogram()+
    facet_wrap(~year,scales = 'free_x')
# Annual maximum flow + local polynomial regression fitting
ggplot(am_flow, aes(x = year, y = am_flow))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = T, span = 0.30,color = "blue")
```

Or let's try some interactive plot using `dygraph` package 

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}
# Interactive plots  
hflow_ts <- as.xts(hflow,hflow$datetime)
hflow_ts[,5] %>% dygraph %>% dyRangeSelector()
```

### 13. Examples of fitting a model to the high flow data and visualizing it 

```{r, eval=T, echo=T,warning= F, message=F,cache=FALSE}

# simple linear model 
mod1 <- lm(events ~ year, data =exceedance)
#Poisson regression 
mod2 <- glm2(events ~ year, data =exceedance,family="poisson")
# mod2 summary
summary(mod2)
pred_y <- fitted(mod2)
# plot all in one graphic 
ggplot() + 
  theme_bw() +
  geom_point(data = exceedance, aes(x = year, y = events))+
  geom_line(data = exceedance, aes(x = year, y = events))+
  geom_smooth(data = exceedance, aes(x = year, y = events), 
              method = "lm",color = "red")+
  geom_smooth(data = exceedance, aes(x = year, y = events), 
              method = "loess",span = 0.30,se=T,color = "blue")+
  geom_line(data = exceedance, aes(x = year, y = pred_y), colour ="blue",size = 1)
```
